## Mindmapping Smoking - Getting started

1. Use any mind-mapping software of your choice - we tend it to use [Xmind](https://www.xmind.net/)

2. As a group, take about 25 minutes to develop a maximal dataset for 'smoking status' 

Use this image as a start point

3. Rejoin the main channel and we will compare notes with the other group, and look at examples from the international CKM.
